# RNA-Translator
Translates RNA sequences into amino acid sequences.
This program was based off of the similar one found here: https://github.com/akash-coder-20/Biocodes
My version scans until it finds a start codon, starts translating there, and stops when it reaches a stop codon. 
As such, it only gives the first reading frame for the given sequence.
